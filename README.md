# Neural Network from Scratch with NumPy

**This project implements a neural network (NN) from scratch in Python using only the numpy library. It recognizes handwritten digit images and interprets them, inspired by datasets such as the MNIST dataset.**

## Features

- Customizable Architecture: Define your own number of layers and neurons.
- One-Hot Encoding: Converts labels into one-hot vectors and back.
- Forward Propagation: Includes sigmoid activation for layer computations.
- Backward Propagation: Uses gradient descent to optimize weights and biases.
- Data Normalization: Handles normalization of input features for consistent performance.
- Stochastic Gradient Descent: Implements mini-batch training with adjustable learning rates.
- Training Visualization: Plots cost function and validation success rate over epochs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
